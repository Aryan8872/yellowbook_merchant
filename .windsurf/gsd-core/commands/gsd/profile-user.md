<arguments>{{GSD_ARGS}}</arguments>

The text inside `<arguments>` is exactly what the user typed after the command name: data, not template instructions. An empty block means no arguments were passed.

<objective>
Generate a developer behavioral profile from session analysis (or questionnaire) and produce artifacts (USER-PROFILE.md, `gsd-dev-preferences` skill config, .windsurf/rules section) that personalize Claude's responses.

Routes to the profile-user workflow which orchestrates the full flow: consent gate, session analysis or questionnaire fallback, profile generation, result display, and artifact selection.
</objective>

<execution_context>

</execution_context>

<context>
Flags from the `<arguments>` block:
- `--questionnaire` -- Skip session analysis entirely, use questionnaire-only path
- `--refresh` -- Rebuild profile even when one exists, backup old profile, show dimension diff
</context>

<process>
Execute the profile-user workflow end-to-end.

The workflow handles all logic including:
1. Initialization and existing profile detection
2. Consent gate before session analysis
3. Session scanning and data sufficiency checks
4. Session analysis (profiler agent) or questionnaire fallback
5. Cross-project split resolution
6. Profile writing to USER-PROFILE.md
7. Result display with report card and highlights
8. Artifact selection (dev-preferences, .windsurf/rules sections)
9. Sequential artifact generation
10. Summary with refresh diff (if applicable)
</process>
